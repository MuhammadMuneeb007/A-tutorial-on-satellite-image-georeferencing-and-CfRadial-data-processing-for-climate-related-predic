All the datasets cannot be provided publically, so we provided one sample file named "radar.nc", which can be downloaded from the following link. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n8cHSeAwP7uae-MA_6KuhC3JVPZr2K2Z/view?usp=sharing

NetCDF files exist in many formats, but look at the format we used before using the code presented in this repository. Also, ensure that all the variables exist in the RADAR.NC file.
